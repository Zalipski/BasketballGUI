The goal of this project is to build a "successful shot probability" GUI with Python, that allows a user to choose two NBA basketball players as well as the position from where one player shoots the basketball and the other defends the shot. After choosing those parameters, the GUI then shows the probability of the shot to go in. For that, the GUI contains an abstract version of one side of a basketball court where the user can choose the positions of both players by clicking on the court, the players can be selected via a text box.
The data I use contains every shot that was taken in the games of the 2013 and 2014 NBA seasons, which I got from https://github.com/hwchase17/sportvu.
