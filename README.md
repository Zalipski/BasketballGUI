The goal of this project was to build a "successful shot probability" GUI with Python, that allows a user to choose a NBA basketball player to throw the ball as well as the position from where the player shoots the basketball and the other defends the shot. After choosing those parameters, the GUI then shows the probability of the shot to go in. For that, the GUI contains an abstract version of one side of a basketball court where the user can choose the positions of both players by clicking on the court, the shooter can be selected via a dropdown menu. The data I use contains every shot that was taken in the games of the 2013 and 2014 NBA seasons, which I got from https://github.com/hwchase17/sportvu.
